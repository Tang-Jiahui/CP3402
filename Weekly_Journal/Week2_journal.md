# Week 2 - Joomla CMS

## Learning Activities & Resources 

In the second week of learning, I installed Joomla on Siteground. The hosting site helped me install Joomla 4.4.0. I tried not to mess with the settings of Joomla as much as possible, and instead focused on learning the basics. The content covered understanding the page structure of Joomla, how to set page titles and text, how to add images, and how to apply templates. During this period, I also looked for some templates on the Internet. Try to understand the difference between template and quick start in Joomla. Finally, I started Assignment 2 with a simple start, came up with the title “QuickEvent” for Assignment 2, which is about online event office tools, and tried to start the content that needs to be started in Joomla according to the requirements of Weekly Practical 2.

## Practical:

I installed Joomla 4.4.0 on Siteground and completed the simple start for Assignment 2 on Joomla, editing the page title, image and text using a free template found on the internet.

## Estimated Hours:

About 4 hours to complete the learning and use of Joomla, as well as basic web pages.

## Content Insights 

In the process of using the template, I found that there are some components on the template that I cannot control. For example, when publishing an article, the article will display the name of the publisher and other information such as the time. I tried to turn them off in the settings, but they were not turned off, which instead prevented the introduction picture of the article from loading. Moreover, after turning it off once and then turning it on again, the picture could not be displayed, and I could only delete the entire article and reset it. So I need to consider whether to change the template while the assignment is in progress.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In the process of using Joomla, I think there may be some unreliable factors in the Joomla template, which may cause inconvenience at work. Moreover, from a modern point of view, the cumbersomeness of Joomla may not be suitable for today's fast work requirements.
