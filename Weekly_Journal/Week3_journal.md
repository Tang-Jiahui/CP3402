# Week 3 - WordPress CMS & Group Interviews

## Learning Activities & Resources 

In the third week of learning, I installed WordPress on Siteground. The managed website helped me install WordPress 6.7.1. I tried to learn the content, including understanding the page structure of Joomla, how to set page titles and text, and how to add images. I tried to imitate the page I created with Joomla in the second week as much as possible.

## Practical:

I installed WordPress on Siteground and created new pages with WordPress that mimic the pages I created with Joomla in week 2.

## Estimated Hours:

About 2 hours to learn about how to use the WordPress and complete the weekly practical.

## Content Insights 

In the process of using WordPress, I found that WordPress is much more convenient than Joomla. You can directly edit the page, which makes the work more intuitive. However, problems may arise at the code level, and if you are using a template, you need to be more careful when editing the page.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In the process of using WordPress, I think WordPress is more in line with modern operations because it is more convenient and easier to use, which is convenient for users who have not learned how to edit html to create simple web pages.
