# Prac 10 - Presentation Rehearsals

## Learning Activities & Resources

In preparation for our group presentation, we followed the recommended approach of conducting a technical check and rehearsal before the actual presentation day. This involved testing the compatibility of our laptops with the presentation equipment and verifying the clarity of our microphones, camera functionality, and overall lighting setup. These checks ensured that there would be no technical disruptions during our real presentation.
We also made use of our team Discord channel to share updates and recordings. This allowed everyone in the group to review the test results and stay informed about any adjustments needed before the rehearsal or final presentation.
We rehearsed the presentation once as a group and used the assignment rubric to evaluate our performance. Although our slide deck was still under refinement, going through a practice run helped us pinpoint key areas needing improvement, including timing, pacing, and transitions between speakers.

## Practical

Before the rehearsal, we tested the presentation equipment and shared results in our Discord group. This included confirming that audio, video, and display settings worked correctly on our individual devices.
During the rehearsal, we have some issues:

1. One of our members was suffering from a sore throat, which caused her to cough uncontrollably during her speaking section.
2. I personally experienced stage anxiety and missed my cue to begin speaking. When I did speak, my pacing was too slow, and my delivery felt disjointed.

Despite these issues, the rehearsal proved incredibly helpful. It gave each of us the chance to understand what needed improvement, and we made adjustments based on those insights.
By the time we gave the actual presentation, everyone had shown noticeable improvement. My own delivery became much faster and smoother, and the member who had been sick was fortunately feeling better and could complete her part successfully.

## Content Insights

The rehearsal highlighted that technical checks are just the foundation—practicing delivery, even with an unfinished script, is essential to improve fluency and timing. Rehearsals allow presenters to become familiar with the flow of their content and catch gaps or awkward transitions early. It also showed how group members can support each other by providing constructive feedback and encouragement.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Practicing under near-real conditions helped develop valuable skills in public speaking, technical preparedness, and team coordination. Overcoming nervousness and adapting under pressure—such as recovering from missed cues or dealing with health issues—mirrors the kind of adaptability required in professional presentations and collaborative environments. These experiences will undoubtedly help in future academic, workplace, or client-facing presentation scenarios.
