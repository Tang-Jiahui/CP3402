# Week 7 - PHP

## Learning Activities & Resources 

In this week’s practical, I focused on implementing basic PHP programming concepts to build a simple, functional web page. This activity was designed to demonstrate my understanding of foundational PHP features, including echo, if/else decisions, for, while, and foreach loops, functions with parameters, and the use of include to manage shared layout components.
The PHP files were structured to reflect good programming practices and modularity. I created a basic two-page site with a reusable header and footer. One page outputs a list of items and performs logic-based output, while the other serves as a static informational page. This task was individual but aligns with our team’s Week 6 setup, where we established GitHub, Trello, and Slack tools—ensuring our future code collaboration will be seamless.
Unfortunately, the group work component could not proceed this week as planned because only three members of our group attended the class. As a result, we could not meet to collaborate or distribute additional tasks. We will aim to regroup and continue as a team in the following week.

## Practical:

Setting Up PHP Files:

1. Created a main file index.php to demonstrate:
2. echo with HTML content.
3. if/else logic to display different messages.
4. for and while loops to output repetitive values.
5. A foreach loop to iterate over an array.
6. Wrote a function in functions.php with a parameter to display items in a list.
7. Created a second page about.php with static content.

Reusability & Structure:

1. Made a header.php and footer.php file.
2. Used include statements to insert them into both main pages.
3. Ensured consistent structure and layout across the site.
4. This hands-on activity helped me reinforce PHP fundamentals while setting the stage for collaborative work in upcoming weeks.

## Estimated Hours:

I used 2 hours to learning and writing the PHP files, 30 minutes for the testing and checking.

## Content Insights 

Completing this practical helped reinforce the importance of mastering basic programming logic. Implementing loops and decisions in PHP highlighted the similarities and differences between server-side scripting and other languages I’ve encountered. Using include helped demonstrate how PHP encourages modular and maintainable code, even in small projects. Additionally, the act of building even a simple site from scratch builds confidence and solidifies key programming concepts. This task serves as a foundation for larger, collaborative development.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Basic PHP skills are still highly relevant in many backend web development roles. The ability to organize code into reusable components (include), write logic with conditionals and loops, and pass data through functions are essential skills not only in PHP but across most programming languages.
Furthermore, this activity prepared me for collaborative work using GitHub, which we set up during Week 6. Being able to commit structured, readable code to a shared repository will be important when working in a team. It also helped reinforce the discipline of documenting and testing code before collaboration. Although we couldn’t make progress on the group work this week due to low attendance, the individual work allowed me to continue developing my own skills. I’m confident this preparation will benefit our team when we resume working together in future weeks.
