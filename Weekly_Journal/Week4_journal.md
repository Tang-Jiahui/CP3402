## Estimated Hours:

Almost 1 hour to learn about local development environment and finish the practical.

## Content Insights 

In the process of building and using the local development environment. I realized that the local development environment does not need to be bound to the network connection. Except for the need to connect to the network. Almost most of the work can be developed and completed locally, and do not need to consider if the development of online in the middle of the disconnection of the network connection.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I think in the realm of work. Building a local development environment is really effective for working without a network. Local work is not affected by the speed of the network. It greatly reduces the chance of accidents where failures occur that prevent work from being saved.
