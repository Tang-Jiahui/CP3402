# Prac 8 - Learning Experiments

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I conducted a learning experiment to test the effectiveness of note-taking as a study strategy compared to passive reading or watching tutorials. I focused on two similar topics in Laravel: form validation and middleware. For Topic A (form validation), I simply read and watched materials without taking any notes. For Topic B (middleware), I actively took handwritten notes while studying.
This experiment was inspired by cognitive psychology theories on active vs passive learning, and designed using the scientific method: hypothesis, testing, analysis, and reflection.

## Practical

Hypothesis
Note-taking during technical study will lead to better memory retention and understanding than studying without notes.

Method：

1. Topic A (Form Validation): Watched and read for 1 hour without taking notes.

2. Topic B (Middleware): Studied for 1 hour while actively summarising and writing notes.

3. The next day: attempted to recall and write a short practice code snippet for both topics.

Results

1. For Topic A, I remembered only basic validation rules and forgot details about custom validation logic.

2. For Topic B, I recalled most key points, including how to generate middleware, register it, and apply it to routes.

3. Practice task for Topic B was completed more accurately and faster.

Conclusion
Taking notes while learning helped me better understand and retain new programming concepts. It encouraged me to actively process the content and gave me a reference to revisit later.

## Estimated Hours

Researching and planning experiment, Studying Topic A and Studying Topic B used 1.5 hours. Practice tasks and recall testing and writing up results and insights used 1 hour.

## Content Insights

This experiment showed me that the act of writing things down—even just in rough note form—forces a deeper engagement with the material. I noticed that I naturally began to “teach the concept to myself” as I wrote, which made complex ideas like middleware more approachable. Compared to passive reading, I was far more likely to remember syntax, logic, and best practices.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

In a professional setting, especially in development roles, it's essential not just to “use” a tool or framework, but to understand how and why it works. This experiment reinforced the idea that learning strategies directly impact how well I’ll be able to perform in future roles. Strong note-taking and summarisation habits can also support documentation practices, onboarding, and mentoring others—skills that are valued in any tech team.
This experiment also motivated me to begin maintaining a lightweight personal knowledge base or wiki, which could become a valuable learning and career asset in the future. Good learners make good developers—and this week reminded me of that.
