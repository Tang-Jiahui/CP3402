# Week 1 - Basic Web Design

## Learning Activities & Resources 

During the first week of CP3402, I reviewed how to create CSS and HTML. I also reviewed the knowledge I learned about static websites in CP1406. I learned how to use Siteground to publish my website and how to use Siteground.

While reviewing the knowledge of CP1406, I went through my previous assignments and used them as a template for Week 1 practical work. In other words, I reacquainted myself with the structural framework of HTML and CSS and relearned the layout and allocation of the website.

I used Siteground to publish my website because I am more accustomed to using this website.

## Practical:

For the startup, I chose to make a website that introduces art studios. I used the previous assignment for CP1406 as a template to create the website. I use Siteground to host my website.

## Estimated Hours:

About 6 hours to finish the practical from begin to review html and css to publish the website.

## Content Insights 

In the process of using the hosting website, I found that Siteground can import WordPress directly into the website and use it to create a website. But this assignment says that you cannot use WordPress, Wix, or other website builders, so while learning about Siteground, I learned how to import WordPress into a hosting website for use in the next assignment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

While exploring the features of Siteground, I gained a certain understanding of the managed website. I believe that becoming more proficient in using managed websites will help me be more efficient and learn faster when building websites, which will be very helpful if I choose to pursue a career in website building in the future.
